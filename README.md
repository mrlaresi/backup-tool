# Backup tool
As of writing this file the program runs only on terminal
and only copies the files to the folder it's run from.

## What can it do?
The programs purpose is to easily backup given files/folders.

The program reads filepaths from a file and upon command
recursively copies the files contained in that filepath to a
new location.

Users can:
- add new filepaths
- order the program to run backup
